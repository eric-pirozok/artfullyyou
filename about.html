As an accomplished artist and experienced youth art instructor, Amy Pirozok (Miss Amy) has a passion for teaching a variety of art skills to youth, encouraging them to discover their own ability to create as well as grow in confidence in their individual skills. Amy teaches both online Zoom and in-person art lessons and classes. On occasion, she will paint a commissioned pet portrait and/or mural. In her spare time, she enjoys spending time with family, friends, and her German Shepherd.<br><br>
Amy’s passion for teaching art comes from the calling God has put on her life. She believes God has called her to raise up child artists to show God’s glory to the world. Only when you are doing what God has designed you to do, will you experience joy and peace.<br><br>
