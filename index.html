	If your child will miss their scheduled class for any reason, please let me know in advance. If they are sick, please let me know before the class begins.

	If your child is sick, please keep them home. They need to be fever free for 24 hours before returning to class.<br><br>
	Please make sure to have your child dress appropriately for art. I cannot guarantee paint (or other medium) free clothes!<br><br>
	Eli (my German Shepherd dog) is our art class mascot 🙂 He is awesome with students, but if your child is uncomfortable with dogs, please let me know and I will make sure he is kept in his kennel during your child’s art class.<br><br>
	Art classes are invoiced on the first of each month via email. You have 30 days to pay, and can pay online via a link in the email, cash or check (made payable to Radiant Light Broadcasting).
